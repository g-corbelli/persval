# persval
The persval package provides functions for computing personal values scores from various questionnaires based on the theoretical constructs proposed by Schwartz (Schwartz, 1992, 1996, 2015; Schwartz et al., 2017). Designed to assist researchers and practitioners in psychology, sociology, and related fields, the package facilitates the quantification of different dimensions related to personal values from survey data and the graphical representation of their relative importance. It incorporates the recommended statistical adjustment (ipsatization) to enhance the accuracy and interpretation of the results. Supported questionnaires within the package include SVS-57, the Schwartz Value Survey with 57 items (Schwartz, 1992); PVQ-40, the Portrait Values Questionnaire with 40 items (Schwartz, 2006; Schwartz et al., 2001); PVQ-21/ESS-21, the shortened version of PVQ used in the European Social Survey (Schwartz, 2003); TwIVI, the Twenty Item Values Inventory (Sandy et al., 2017); TIVI, the Ten Item Values Inventory (Sandy et al., 2017).
The package includes functions to generate spider charts that graphically depict the relative importance of each of the ten basic personal values and the four higher order values, making it easier to present, interpret, and confront visually an individual's or group's value orientation.
     
Note: This package is independently developed based on Schwartzâ€™s theoretical framework and is not directly endorsed by Professor Schwartz. Researchers are advised to consult the original studies and validation articles for comprehensive insights into the theoretical and empirical basis of the instruments used (e.g.: Closs, 1996; Cornwell & Dunlop, 1994; Rudnev, 2021; Saris, 1988; Schwartz, 1992, 1996, 2015; Schwartz et al., 2017; Smith, 2004; Van Rosmalen et al., 2010).
